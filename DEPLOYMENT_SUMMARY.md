# Deployment Summary - Car Washing App

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard UI Improvements
- **Removed figure cards (stats)** for user role - users no longer see statistics like total bookings, vehicles, money saved, and next booking
- **Removed "My Vehicles" from Quick Actions** - this option is no longer available in the user's quick actions menu
- **Removed "Book a Service" button** from the header next to the user's name - cleaner header design

### 2. Vehicle Management Bug Fixes
- **Fixed vehicle addition in BookingPage** - now uses the proper API service instead of raw fetch calls
- **Improved error handling** - better error messages when vehicle creation fails
- **Fixed TypeScript type issues** - resolved compilation errors related to vehicle type definitions
- **Updated API integration** - consistent use of apiService throughout the application

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- **Better error handling** - more descriptive error messages for users
- **Type safety** - fixed TypeScript type casting issues
- **API consistency** - unified API service usage across components
